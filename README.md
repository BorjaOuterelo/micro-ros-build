# micro-ROS build support

## Installation and Building

This package contains submodules. Please clone it using

```git clone --recursive ...```

Building this package requires that you have [ROS 2 Crystal](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Crystal/) installed first.

## micro_ros_setup

Support scripts for creating Micro-ROS agent and client workspaces,
and cleanly doing cross-compilation.

See [micro_ros_setup README](micro_ros_setup/README.md) for usage instructions.

## micro_ros_cmake

This is a Work-in-Progress package that aims to add
CMake macros and vendor packages for building micro-ROS.
This should make it even easier to create applications.

See [micro_ros_cmake README](micro_ros_cmake/README.md) for more info.
